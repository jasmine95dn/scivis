## Feedback
+ Problem 1.1 - 2/2; The answer is correct. But also note that there were few other problems with the graph - e.x. The left bar has always the same value, providing no additional information
+ Problem 1.2 - 2/2 
+ Problem 1.4 - 1/2; The complete plot with logarithmic scale was missing. The log scale sometimes reveals more aspects about the plot. Since it squeezes the x-axis and places more importance on the variations on the y-axis. 
+ Problem 1.5 - 2/2
+ Problem 1.6 - 1/2; The 3D plot was missing.

Total Points - 8/10; Scaled  - 80/100
