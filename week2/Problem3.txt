Problem 3:
a)
Curvilinear (irregular) grid:
Advantages:
- Regular topology
- Topology still implicit
- Much more flexible alternative to model arbitrarily shaped objects

Disadvantages:
- Irregular spacing between grid nodes
- Nonlinear scaling of positions along either axis
- Node positions have to be stored explicitly
- Cells are rectangular
- Geometric structure might result in concave grids

b)
Unstructured grid:
Advantages:
- Can be adapted to local features
- More efficient than direct approach in terms of memory requirements

Disadvantages:
- Storage space, redundancy
- Additionally store the data values
- Still have to do global search to find local information 

c)
Multi-uniform grid:
Advantages:
- Spacing between grid nodes is constant in each dimension
- Necessarily convex
- Focus on specific areas to avoid unnecessary detail in other areas
- Finter grid for regions of interest

Disadvantages:
- Difficulties in the boundary region (e.g. with interpolation)
- Sorting of grid elements and point location more difficult
